## Copilot
Copilot was primarily used to finish off lines of code, which more often than not ended up being checked over and altered by us anyway. It was not used to generate entire files or even entire functions.  
We have the following estimates for Copilot usage:  

**Backend**
- `src/routes/*` 15% generated by Copilot, primarily the use of TypeORM repository accessor functions
- `src/db/*` 10% generated by Copilot, primarily type completions
- `src/index.ts` no use of Copilot
- `src/types.ts` no use of Copilot

**Frontend**  
Note: some of the files in the frontend were taken from a Tailwind UI Template. These files are marked with a comment at the top of each and whether they were also modified by us or not.
- `src/api/*` 5% generated by Copilot, most of this was handwritten in one file then copy-pasted for the rest
- `src/app/*` 15% generated by Copilot, primarily tailwind class names or basic if else completions
- `src/components/*` 10% generated by Copilot, primarily tailwind class names or basic if else completions
- `src/lib/*` no use of Copilot
- `src/types.ts` no use of Copilot

## ChatGPT
ChatGPT was primarily used for basic research into library configurations and other basic information. It was also used to generate the mock database data in `backend/src/db/mockData.sql`.
